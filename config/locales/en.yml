  about_general: 'The objective of this application is to serve as a platform to exchange ideas about the evolution of humanity. Users can discover the Futures created by others, or write their own scenarios. Each Future should include a title, a general description, a predicted year of realization, as well as several alternative Outcomes. These Outcomes can be either positive, neutral or negative. '
  about_example: "For example, the Future 'What if a government or a company succeeded in developing a strong AI?' might lead to three possibilities: an era of peace and prosperity for all humanity (positive Outcome), barely any change (neutral Outcome), or a rebellion of the machines followed by a dark age (negative Outcome). Of course, not all scenarios need to be so extreme!"
  about_chronology: 'Users need to be registered in order to create a Future with its Outcomes, or comment on existing Futures. Registered Users can also upvote Futures, Outcomes and Comments. Every visitor, whether or not he/she is registered on the application, may also select some Futures of interest and display them in the Chronology, in order to see them in a consistent timeline.'

  statistics_score: 'For each Future, a score between 0% and 100% is computed. This score is based on the number of times Users have upvoted the positive, neutral and negative Outcomes associated with this Future. An upvoted positive Outcome gives 1 point, an upvoted neutral Outcome gives 0.5 point, and an upvoted negative Outcome gives nothing. The total number of points for a Future, divided by the total number of upvotes for its Outcomes, gives the Future score.'
  statistics_expectations: 'Therefore, a Future with a score close to 0% is expected to be relatively negative. A Future with a score close to 100% is expected to be relatively positive. A Future with a score around 50% may be neutral or uncertain. By default, all new Futures start with a score of 50%.'
  statistics_horizons: 'The following graphs show the distribution of the scores at different time horizons. These distributions offer a glimpse of what the general Future could look like, by ponderating the expectations of Users about all the Futures created in the application.'
